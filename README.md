# Statement

Statement parses RSS feeds and HTML pages containing press releases and other official statements from members of Congress, and produces hashes with information about those pages. It has been tested under Ruby 1.9.2, 1.9.3 and 2.0.0.

## Coverage

Statement currently parses press releases for members of the House and Senate. For members with RSS feeds, you can pass the feed URL into Statement. For members without RSS feeds (or with broken ones), HTML scrapers are provided, as are methods for special groups, such as House Republicans. Suggestions are welcomed.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'statement'
```

And then execute:

```sh
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```sh
$ gem install statement
```

## Usage

Statement provides access to press releases, Facebook status updates and tweets from members of Congress. Most congressional offices have RSS feeds but some require HTML scraping.

To configure Statement to pull from the Twitter and Facebook APIs, you can pass in configuration values via a hash or a `config.yml` file:

```ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'statement'
Statement.configure(:oauth_token => token, :oauth_token_secret => secret, ...) # option 1
Statement.configure_with("config.yml") # option 2
```

If you don't need to use the Twitter or Facebook APIs, you don't need to setup configuration.

### Press Releases

To parse an RSS feed, simply pass the URL to Statement's Feed class:

```ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'statement'

results = Statement::Feed.from_rss('http://blumenauer.house.gov/index.php?option=com_bca-rss-syndicator&feed_id=1')
puts results.first
{:source=>"http://blumenauer.house.gov/index.php?option=com_bca-rss-syndicator&feed_id=1", :url=>"http://blumenauer.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2203:blumenauer-qwe-need-a-national-system-that-speaks-to-the-transportation-challenges-of-todayq&amp;catid=66:2013-press-releases", :title=>"Blumenauer: &quot;We need a national system that speaks to the transportation challenges of ...", :date=>#<Date: 2013-04-24 ((2456407j,0s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>, :domain=>"blumenauer.house.gov"}
```

Statement will try to parse a date if an RSS feed contains a `PubDate` element; if not it will return `nil`.

If you have a batch of RSS URLs, you can pass them to Feed's `batch` class method, which will use Typhoeus to fetch them in parallel and returns a two-element array of results and failed urls:

```ruby
urls = ['http://aderholt.house.gov/common/rss//index.cfm?rss=20', 'http://andrews.house.gov/rss.xml', "http://alexander.house.gov/common/rss/?rss=24", "http://amash.house.gov/rss.xml"]
results, failures = Statement::Feed.batch(urls)
```

The sites that require HTML scraping are detailed in individual methods, and can be called individually or in bulk:

```ruby
results = Statement::Scraper.billnelson
members = Statement::Scraper.member_scrapers
```

### Facebook Updates

Using the `koala` gem, Statement can fetch Facebook status feeds, given a Facebook ID. You'll need to either set environment variables `APP_ID` and `APP_SECRET` or create a `config.yml` file containing `app_id` and `app_secret` keys and values.

```ruby
f = Statement::Facebook.new
results = f.feed('RepFincherTN08')
```

It also can process IDs in batches by passing an array of IDs and a `slice` argument to indicate how many ids in each batch:

```ruby
f = Statement::Facebook.new
results = f.batch(facebook_ids, 10)
```

In all cases Statement strips out posts that are not by the ID, and returns a Hash containing attributes from the feed:

```ruby
{:id=>"9307301412_10151632750071413", :body=>"This is Gold Star Mother Larraine McGee whose son, Christopher Everett, Army National Guard, was killed in action September 2005. Precious family.", :link=>"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151632750021413&set=a.118418671412.133511.9307301412&type=1&relevant_count=1", :title=>nil, :type=>"photo", :status_type=>"added_photos", :created_time=>#<DateTime: 2013-05-28T14:49:08+00:00 ((2456441j,53348s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>, :updated_time=>#<DateTime: 2013-05-28T17:41:37+00:00 ((2456441j,63697s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>, :facebook_id=>"9307301412"}
```

### Tweets

Using the `twitter` gem, Statement can retrieve individual user timelines or list timelines:

```ruby
t = Statement::Tweets.new
t.timeline('Robert_Aderholt')
[{:id=>344168849484169216, :body=>"Check out the @GOPLeader's weekly schedule for the House this week. http://t.co/mh3FZnK4a8", :link=>"http://majorityleader.gov/floor/weekly.html", :in_reply_to_screen_name=>nil, :total_tweets=>699, :created_time=>2013-06-10 15:07:02 -0400, :retweets=>0, :favorites=>0, :screen_name=>"Robert_Aderholt"}...]
```
Note that the `created_time` attribute is a Ruby Time object, as returned by the `twitter` gem.

To retrieve a list's timeline, pass in the list slug and the owner (defaults to nil):

```ruby
t = Statement::Tweets.new
t.bulk_timeline('congress')
[:id=>343541632844587008, :body=>"On the Skagit river getting a close-up view of the bridge repairs. http://t.co/SMsdwiFaR6", :link=>nil, :in_reply_to_screen_name=>nil, :total_tweets=>226, :created_time=>2013-06-08 21:34:42 -0400, :retweets=>1, :favorites=>2, :screen_name=>"RepDelBene"}..]
```

## Tests

Statement uses MiniTest, to run tests:

```sh
$ rake test
```
